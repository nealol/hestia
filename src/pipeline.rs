//! The write pipeline: store paths → chunks → packs → manifest commit.
//!
//! Runs on drain (action post-step or idle-exit). Steps:
//!
//! 1. Query path info from the store database for every buffered path,
//!    expanded to its runtime closure unless disabled.
//! 2. Filter: invalid paths, upstream-signed paths (when the upstream
//!    cache filter is enabled), paths already in the manifest (those get
//!    their `last_pushed` clock bumped instead).
//! 3. Chunk each new path (FastCDC over NAR events) and verify the chunked
//!    representation reproduces the NAR hash recorded by Nix.
//! 4. Pack new chunks, upload the pack (Twirp reserve → Azure PUT →
//!    finalize; `already_exists` means an identical pack is already there).
//! 5. Commit the manifest: new path entries, chunk locations, pack ref, and
//!    the root for this branch+system = pushed ∪ accessed paths.
//!    SaveMutable handles write conflicts by re-merging.
